# Heart Failure Risk Prediction

This project leverages machine learning to predict the risk of heart failure in patients based on clinical records. The model is built using PyTorch and deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit.

## 🧠 Model Overview

- **Model Type**: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- **Framework**: PyTorch
- **Dataset**: [Heart Failure Clinical Records Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/519/heart+failure+clinical+records) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Features**: 12 clinical features including age, ejection fraction, serum creatinine, and more
- **Target**: DEATH_EVENT (binary classification: 0 = survived, 1 = death)
